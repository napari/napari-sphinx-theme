Welcome to napari Sphinx Theme's documentation!
===============================================

This is the official Sphinx theme for napari documentation.
It extends the `pydata_sphinx_theme project <https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__,
but adds custom styling.

Use it by changing this line in your conf.py file

.. code-block:: python

   html_theme = 'napari_sphinx_theme'

And by including ``napari_sphinx_theme`` as a requirement in your documentation
installation.
