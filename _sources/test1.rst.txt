Test 1

A bunch of words.

.. note::

    This is how an admonition with multiple paragraphs looks like.

    It can include many words.

There is also some text between admonitions.

.. warning::

    * How is the padding in this list?
    * Is it consistent?
    * Does it look good with other elements?

.. attention::

    Keep track of spacing and margins in admonitions.

    * This is how they look like;
    * Rely on upstream as much as possible.

And this is how an admonition with a title looks like:

.. admonition:: You can use titles!

    Sometimes they are helpful.
